        <h1>What We Do</h1>
        <p>The unique Ekhaya Multi Arts Centre (EMAC Centre) opened in September 2003. It is the vision of the Kwa Mashu Community Advancement Projects for integrated arts development in Kwa Mashu Township – an urban renewal node as prioritised by President Mbeki in 2001. The organization recognized that there was a critical shortage of arts and culture related facilities for disadvantaged Kwa Zulu – Natal communities and identified Kwa Mashu as the most viable location for a multi – arts centre.</p>
    
        <p>Ekhaya is a multi-purpose space for showcasing presentations and performances. It houses various facilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ekhaya Compute Lab (with Internet)</li>

            <li>Community radio VIBE FM facilities</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>The centre actively involves the community in:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Artistic performances and exhibitions</li>

        </ul>
    
        <p>The Kwa Mashu Community Advancement Projects (K-CAP) is a non-profit organization (012-391 NPO) founded in 1993 and currently has a credible seven-member board. It is the unique integrated arts organization in Kwa Zulu-Natal and the only organization that has built its own unique Ekhaya Multi Arts Centre in Kwa Mashu, the oldest township of Durban.</p>
    
        <p>The organization has a reputation for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Producing internationally acclaimed theatre productions annually</li>
            <li>Implementing reputable integrated arts training programs</li>
            <li>Running annual events of national and international status</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Edmund Mhlongo, the current Artistic Director and founder, has been instrumental in the success of the organization, fostering artistic excellence and community engagement.</p>
    
        <p>Kwa Mashu, historically known for its rich cultural heritage, has undergone significant transformation and development. Originally created in 1958 through forced removals from Cato Manor (Mkhumbane), Kwa Mashu became the first township in Durban.</p>
        
        <p>The housing types in Kwa Mashu range from the originally built red brick 2-roomed and 4-roomed houses to more developed structures. With residents supplementing incomes, many houses have been expanded into 5-6 roomed houses, some featuring quality face-bricks. The late 1970s witnessed additional housing developments, particularly in Section D, resembling mansion-style architecture.</p>
    
        <p>In 1999, Kwa Mashu was designated a Presidential Urban Renewal Strategy Programme site at the Presidential Job Summit. The strategy aimed to build infrastructure and enhance functional policing for improved security, subsequently branded as INK. The initiative prioritized interventions targeting job creation and poverty alleviation, identified through a project scan. The area remains a national priority project for Urban Renewal, addressing social dislocation and hardships caused by forced removals from Cato Manor during the 1950s and 1960s. Kwa Mashu continues to grapple with challenges, including high unemployment rates and social cohesion issues, despite being home to a population exceeding 800,000 people. The demographic predominantly consists of young individuals, with over 51% being females.</p>
